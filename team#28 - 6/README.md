Our idea is based on theme 6 which is Intelligent Transportation System for smart cities
Due to this current pandemic situation it is very unsafe for people to travel in public transport as usually they are full and any rules of social distancing are not followed in them.
So we have decided to build an app which will give the number of passengers in the public transport buses which the user has chosen and thus it will give an idea that rules of social distancing are maintained or not in the bus at current time and it is safe to travel or not.
The app will also give the recent location of the bus.
Our app name is SafeTravel
